###Requirements

When the user is scrolling down the header must be decreased to just the navigation menu.

The transition must happen smoothly. Logo and the search input should not dissapear during the transition 

When scrolling back up, the menu should return to the original state.

This transition must happen at 400px from the top of the page threshold
