###Description

Requirements

   * List of currently created badges with name, status (active/disabled)

   * Create page where the store owner can create a new badge entity and select badge image, name and activate/disable it

   * Edit badge page where the store owner can change badge image, change its name and activate/disable it

   * Mass action block with options to disable/enable multiple badges and delete selected badges

   * In the frontend, the badge should be displayed in the top-left corner of the product image (anywhere it appears. Including Related products, Cross-sells, Product list etc...)
